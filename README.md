# LifeSchedule

This project is an implementation of the excellent [Tim Urban's](https://waitbutwhy.com/wait-but-who) concept of a [Life Calendar](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) — a somewhat grim reminder of how short life is, and hopefully a motivational tool to quit wasting it on Netflix marathons and total assimilation into the GTA universe.

If you're interested in seeing the Life Calendar in context of how it can help with procrastination, check out Tim's hilarious TED talk: ["Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)

## Project Roadmap

This app is something I will be working on chiefly during 10% time at work, so updates may be a little sporadic. The basic version should:

* Support a single user account, who can:
    * View their life as a projection of 90 years, broken down into a selection of weeks
    * Weeks already lived will be indicated as passed
    * Add goals to future weeks, with deadlines
    
 Future versions will hopefully allow lots of different features, such as:
 
 * __"How do you compare with <x> famous person?"__ — want to feel bad about your choices? Activate an overlay of some of your heroes' achievements and see where they were at the same point in your own life. Ouch.
 * __"Variable Life Expectancy"__ — The MVP will give everyone an average of 90 years lifespan, but it would be interesting to be able to change that based on a bunch of different variables such as location, lifestyle and genetic factors.
 
 ## Technologies
 
 Currently I am working in a C# shop, using React on the client side, so these are the tools I will be using to build this.
